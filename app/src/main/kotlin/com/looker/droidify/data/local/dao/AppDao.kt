     * [com.looker.droidify.data.model.selectForDevice] / isInstallableOnDevice: a version counts only

     * F-Droid + IzzyOnDroid) that publish different newest versions, and grouping per-repo would let an
     * older repo's max hide a newer build elsewhere (so an available update wouldn't show). Taking the
     * MAX across every repo mirrors the detail screen, which installs the newest version wherever it is.
     *
     * Multi-ABI apps (e.g. RustDesk) publish one APK per ABI under *different* versionCodes, so the
     * device-compatibility filter runs first, otherwise a device-blind MAX would pick another
     * architecture's higher code and flag an update the detail screen then refuses to install.
     *
     * The bare `signer` column is read from the same row the `MAX(versionCode)` came from — SQLite's
