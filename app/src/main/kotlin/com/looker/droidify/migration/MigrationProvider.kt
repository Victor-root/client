/**
 * Hands this install's data to the other release channel, so switching from the beta to the stable
 * build keeps everything instead of starting from an empty app.
 *
 * The two channels are separate apps to Android (see the beta build type's applicationIdSuffix), which
 * is exactly why this exists: the stable build cannot inherit anything, it has to come and ask. What is
 * handed over is the same archive the file export and the device-to-device transfer already produce,
 * rather than any internal state, so a beta can go on changing its own storage across releases without
 * the migration path drifting out of step with it.
 *
 * Declared only in the beta build's manifest (src/beta/AndroidManifest.xml): the beta is the side being
 * migrated away from, and a stable build has nobody to hand anything to. That keeps this off the stable
 * app entirely rather than leaving an exported component there for a job that is already done.
 *
 * The archive carries repository passwords and the GitHub token, so every call is refused unless the
 * caller is signed with the same key as this app. That is the whole of the trust model, and it is the
 * right one here: only builds of Omnify carry that signature, and anyone who had the key could publish
 * updates outright, so there is nothing this could leak that would still be theirs to protect.
